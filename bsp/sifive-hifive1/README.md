HiFive1 is a low-cost, Arduino-compatible development board featuring the Freedom E310. It’s the best way to start prototyping and developing your RISC‑V applications.

his FPGA core target is ideal maker and hobbist to develop running application software building on top of freedom-metal libraries. The target supports:
        - 1 hart with RV32IMAC core
        - 4 hardware breakpoints
        - Physical Mempory Protectin with 8 regions
        - 16 local interrupts signal that can be connected to off core complex devices
        - Up to 127 PLIC interrupt signals that can be connected to off core complex devices, with 7 priority levels
        - GPIO memory with 16 interrupt lines
        - SPI memory with 1 intterupt line
        - Serial port with 1 interrupt line
        - 1 RGB LEDS
